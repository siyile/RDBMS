2. Meta-data page in an index file
- Show your meta-data page of an index design if you have any. 
We have a meta data at pageNum 0 for indicating root page.

3. Index Entry Format
- Show your index entry design (structure). 
Entry in leaf node : <INDICATOR, KEY, RID> <1, key_size, 6> (bytes)
Entry in non-leaf node : <INDICATOR, KEY, PAGE_NUM> <1, key_size, 4> (bytes)

INDICATOR in leaf node is to indicate deleted or not.
INDICATOR in non-leaf node is reversed for future use.

PAGE_NUM is the pageNum for the next child Page

4. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.

The whole page can be separated into six parts:
    The first part is non leaf node, whose format was showed above.In non-leaf node, there is always a default
    entry at the beginning of the page.This node has the minimal value of key.
    The second part is free space left, which is in the middle of current page.
    The third part is directories. Each directory has 4 bytes to indicate its offset and length.
    The fourth part is an indicator of whether this page is a leaf node.
    In the fifth part, we allocate extra 4 bytes to store and update the slot number and free space left in this page.
    At the end of page, NEXT_PAGE_NUM is not used in non-leaf page.

    [MIN_NODE, Non Leaf Node, Non Leaf Node, ...

       ..., SLOT, SLOT, LEAF_LAYER_FLAG, Free_Space, SLOT_NUM, NEXT_PAGE_NUM]

- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.

The whole page can be separated into six parts:
    The first part is entries for <key,rid> pairs.
    The second part is free space left, which is in the middle of current page.
    The third part is directories. Each directory has 4 bytes to indicate offset and length.
    The fourth part is an indicator of whether this page is a leaf node.
    In the fifth part, we allocate extra 4 bytes to store and update the slot number and free space left in this page.
    At the end of page, we use NEXT_PAGE_NUM to point to the next leaf page.

    [Leaf Node, Leaf Node, ...

       ..., SLOT, SLOT, LEAF_LAYER_FLAG, Free_Space, SLOT_NUM, NEXT_PAGE_NUM]
